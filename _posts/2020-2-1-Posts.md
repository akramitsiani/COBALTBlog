>A key step toward stronger and more secure ICT systems across different industries is adopting a unified and flexible cybersecurity certification process. Innovations in ICT have been essential in driving growth in Industry 4.0 and quantum technologies, shaping new goals and strategies. However, when different technologies are integrated, security gaps can arise, requiring careful monitoring and eventual certification of the entire system.
