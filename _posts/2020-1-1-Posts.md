title: Scope and Motivation of COBALT project
---


To improve security in different industries, we need a unified and flexible system for cybersecurity certification. Right now, companies often have to follow different standards, which can be inefficient. A single certification system would save time and resources.  

The COBALT project aims to create a Common Certification Model (CCM) that works for all industries, including quantum computing and Industry 4.0. This model will combine existing standards and apply them in a consistent way across various sectors.  

COBALT will also look at new technologies like AI and high-performance computing to see how they can be securely certified, especially for quantum computing, which is important for Europeâ€™s future in AI and computing.  

The project focuses on sharing data securely between industries using trusted systems. COBALT wants to build a decentralized solution where industries can share certification data without always relying on a central authority, making the process faster and more flexible.  

In the end, COBALT aims to create a system that adapts to new technologies and ensures long-term security across industries.
